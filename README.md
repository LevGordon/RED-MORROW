This repository marks the beggining of two journeys:

One is my career as a web developer. More specifically, where will I find myself in 2, 5, 10 years? Will I even go on that long or what if go on for the rest of my life? Who knows and surprise is one of life's many pleasures, so all I can do is take it in stride with my arms open. All I know right now - is that this project is the first thing I will accomplish as a solo developer. No academic tutors, no classmates to share answers with, just me and the web. Success within an academic environment does not prove ones capability of achievment, only achievments do and those are earned through actions and effort. This shall be my first.

The second journey is the project itself. Let me talk about it for a second (to perhaps 1-2 people who will have the desire to read this). I, being a proggress-motivated individual with a ever-growing bond to conceiving creative ideas and imlementations, have over-planned this project before it even began, as per usual... 
Whilst many consider overthinking a bad tendency, I think of it as a mere tool. Sorry to get political but this metaphor begs it: A gun is a chunk of metal asssembled in a lethal way and the decisive factor of whether its good or bad is its use. Guns are bad when used to kill people, but good for hunting purposes. 
As always - it is a matter of perspective, and my perspective on the fate of this project is that overthinking is not only acceptable under the circumstances but even encouraged. 

This is a website for my dream. A creative outlet that I am attached to emotionally, like a father is to his child. Music is something I changed my whole life for and it is a gateway to peep inside the most truthful, honest me there is. And if I am so excited for a project that partially represents my dream and a huge part of my identity - why not indulge myself and dive into it headfirst? 

- A chatting screen for fans to discuss songs? Why the hell not?
- The ability to play songs whilst on the website? Lets do it!
- A fully functional/ statistic tracking online shop with merchandise? Lets open YouTube and learn how to do it!

Potential is limitless and in a project where I get to make something for the band I am so deeply invested in - I am my own judge, my own boss and my own god too.
With lightning blasting from my fingertips - this is the place I will attempt the impossible just because I want to.

#UPDATES

8/24/22 - created react app, wrote a heart felt readme (which is likely to change at some point). TLDR - prepared the project for starting when I will be inspired.

8/25/22 - uploaded stock photos of the logo and changed some of the default react app settings. Currently in planning and discussion phase about where to take this as there are a few approaches in my mind.

10/2/22 - Had a team meeting with the lads, we had our disagreements but came to a rough plan of action. Must-have functionality was named and listed, that needs to be developed in a rough form. And then, we can go from there. Simple, yet very artist-esque. We shall see how that goes but this is still, a primarily learning endeavor. 

After some time off I was inspired to start the same day. I laid out a skeletal structure dividing the project into "digestible pieces", to start assembling it bit by bit. Starting with the routes and keeping the virtual "path" a user might take in mind - I created all of the components and worked on routing them. 

Tomorrow, I also plan to contact my designer friend to aid me with a design/styling idea I had for the home page / background images. Will update on that.

10/3/22 - I got in touch with my designer friend but he couldn't talk for long. I briefed him on the ideas and what I need him to do - work will begin tomorrow. Today, I mainly worked on my final capstone for thinkful. But Red Morrow-wise, I mainly focused on getting the routes in order and by the end of the day not quite achieving everything. No biggie - I just need to educate myself on the newer Routes (previously Switch) syntax that came in the newer version of React.

10/5/22 - fixed routing, not enough time for anything else today.
