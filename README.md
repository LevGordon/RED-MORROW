This repository marks the beggining of two journeys:

One is my career as a web developer. More specifically, where will I find myself in 2, 5, 10 years? Will I even go on that long or what if go on for the rest of my life? Who knows and surprise is one of life's many pleasures, so all I can do is take it in stride with my arms open. All I know right now - is that this project is the first thing I will accomplish as a solo developer. No academic tutors, no classmates to share answers with, just me and the web. Success within an academic environment does not prove ones capability of achievment, only achievments do and those are earned through actions and effort. This shall be my first.

The second journey is the project itself. Let me talk about it for a second (to perhaps 1-2 people who will have the desire to read this). I, being a proggress-motivated individual with a ever-growing bond to conceiving creative ideas and imlementations, have over-planned this project before it even began, as per usual... 
Whilst many consider overthinking a bad tendency, I think of it as a mere tool. Sorry to get political but this metaphor begs it: A gun is a chunk of metal asssembled in a lethal way and the decisive factor of whether its good or bad is its use. Guns are bad when used to kill people, but good for hunting purposes. 
As always - it is a matter of perspective, and my perspective on the fate of this project is that overthinking is not only acceptable under the circumstances but even encouraged. 

This is a website for my dream. A creative outlet that I am attached to emotionally, like a father is to his child. Music is something I changed my whole life for and it is a gateway to peep inside the most truthful, honest me there is. And if I am so excited for a project that partially represents my dream and a huge part of my identity - why not indulge myself and dive into it headfirst? 

- A chatting screen for fans to discuss songs? Why the hell not?
- The ability to play songs whilst on the website? Lets do it!
- A fully functional/ statistic tracking online shop with merchandise? Lets open YouTube and learn how to do it!

Potential is limitless and in a project where I get to make something for the band I am so deeply invested in - I am my own judge, my own boss and my own god too.
With lightning blasting from my fingertips - this is the place I will attempt the impossible just because I want to.

#UPDATES

8/24/22 - created react app, wrote a heart felt readme (which is likely to change at some point). TLDR - prepared the project for starting when I will be inspired.

8/25/22 - uploaded stock photos of the logo and changed some of the default react app settings. Currently in planning and discussion phase about where to take this as there are a few approaches in my mind.

10/2/22 - Had a team meeting with the lads, we had our disagreements but came to a rough plan of action. Must-have functionality was named and listed, that needs to be developed in a rough form. And then, we can go from there. Simple, yet very artist-esque. We shall see how that goes but this is still, a primarily learning endeavor. 

After some time off I was inspired to start the same day. I laid out a skeletal structure dividing the project into "digestible pieces", to start assembling it bit by bit. Starting with the routes and keeping the virtual "path" a user might take in mind - I created all of the components and worked on routing them. 

Tomorrow, I also plan to contact my designer friend to aid me with a design/styling idea I had for the home page / background images. Will update on that.

10/3/22 - I got in touch with my designer friend but he couldn't talk for long. I briefed him on the ideas and what I need him to do - work will begin tomorrow. Today, I mainly worked on my final capstone for thinkful. But Red Morrow-wise, I mainly focused on getting the routes in order and by the end of the day not quite achieving everything. No biggie - I just need to educate myself on the newer Routes (previously Switch) syntax that came in the newer version of React.

10/5/22 - fixed routing, not enough time for anything else today.

10/6/22 - started working on a NavBar. Made a primitive, yet responsive version. Learned something new today with window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. I got the design plan laid out, will make the links work tomorrow.

10/9/22 - made a footer with working links. Nothing too fancy, just a simple nav-oriented footer to help redirect people upon scrolling all the way down. I also wanted to add links to places outside of the webiste like "Mourn the living music video". This should potentially add flow to the viewer count. Nothing much to say except for - primitive footer done. 

At this point in time I am developing only the bare structure of the website. I want it to be displayable enough for my non-technical bandmates to give me relevant feedback. Looks first - functionality later. I don't like this, but this is a band website and I have to do what I believe is best for the collective.

10/10/22 - adjusted css of the footer, adjusted css of the navbar. Added an onClick to the "menu" button which triggers a state-change and shows a menu of things to click on. For now the design is the same as the footer, but I will work on that tomorrow.

10/11/22 - created the majority of the /shop page. Since we don't have a way of selling shirts abroad or even nationally - the best we can offer is to showcase what we have and invite the people viewing to purchase these things at our next shows. We also offer deliveries in the LA / San Diego area which were mentioned and a link to /contact was added. I also worked on the footer and fixed a few bugs alongside settling on a simpler design and implementing those changes.

10/12/22 - Today was day 1 of the mounr the living music video shoot and therefore only worked in the morning. This whole week is filming and more filming so I don't have much time to code. I did however, manage to work on the responsiveness of the shop and make it adjust layout dependent on screen width. I have transfered useWindowSize() from the navbar to a newly created "utils" folder, where I can use it over and over without duplicating code.

10/13/22 - Theres a lot of filming to be done in the evening, so I worked hastily on this project in the morning. I pretty much finished the contact page (rest will be up to designer and me placing elements in correct spots). It's responsive and shows our contact information. I will need to add links to the images for which I need to view a video tutorial (I want to know how to get access to a link that redirects to an open draft email addressed to Red Morrow. I am also considering adding an email-component from the vast npm selection that will allow users to write an email without leaving the site. (REMEMBER TO DO THIS LEV)
